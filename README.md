## Introduction

A chatbot is defined as a conversational application that aids in customer service, engagement, and support by replacing or augmenting human support agents with artificial intelligence (AI) and other automation technologies that can communicate with end-users via chat.

This project aims to deploy a Chatbot on Facebook Messenger using AWS from scratch, leveraging various AWS services, and ensuring high availability, security, and scalability.

### Steps:

‚è© Open Amazon Lambda Console and create a function by selecting Author from Scratch option and Python 3.9 in Runtime and providing Function Name.
